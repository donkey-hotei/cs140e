Since the compiler cannot make guarantees that the end-user will always read the correct
type of a raw union (i.e: memory unsafe). Exposing the raw union as an enum to the user
of our pi library provides the advantages of unions but with memory safety since the
enumeration will always keep track of whatever particular type it contains.
