The benefit of exposing safe interfaces to unsafe structures or operations in Rust is that
the end-user doesn't have to be intimately concerned with memory management and can trust
that the safe implmentation ensures that memory is managed properly under-the-hood. Yes,
the same benefits could be found in C however, it would be a runtime cost as it's type system
is inferior.
