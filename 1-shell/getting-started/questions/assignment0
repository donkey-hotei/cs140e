GPFSEL registers are organized per ten pins, which means each 32-bit register contains
the setup bits for ten pins. Selecting GPIO pin 16 as output then requires writing the
bit pattern 001 to register GPFSEL1 (setup bits for pins 10 to 19). The three bits in
GPFSEL1 are located in the 18 to 20 bits from the left. Setting and clearing then simply
involves turning on the 16th bit of the GPSET0 and GPCLR0 registers. Doing the same for
pin 17 would require writing 001 to the 21-23rd bits of GPFSEL2, and flipping the 27th
bit of GPSET0 and GPCLR0. GPIO 27 is mapped to the 7th pin from the left on the bottom
row of the Rasperry PI's header pins.
