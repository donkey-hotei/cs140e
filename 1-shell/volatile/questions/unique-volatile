`Volatile` is a wrapper type that enforces _volatile_ (read *or* write) accesses to a
raw pointer. The `Volatile` type also supports aliasing the value pointed to by it's
wrapped pointer. On the other hand we have `UniqueVolatile` which is also a wrapper type
that enforces _volatile_ (read *or* write) access to an underlying raw pointer, the
difference here is that it implements `Sync + Send` and thus must be the only accessible
mutable reference to the value pointed to by the underlying pointer.
